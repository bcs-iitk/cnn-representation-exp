			<h1> Instructions </h1>

			<ul>
				<li> For each feature, there is a <b>sliding bar</b> using which you will have to rate the similarity of that feature in two images on a <b>scale of -5 to 5</b> where <b>-5</b> corresponsds to <b>"Very dissimilar"</b> or "Not similar at all" and <b>5</b> corresponds to <b>"Very similar".</b> 
				<li> <b>Important: Your decision about similarity of features must be based <i>only on the visible content of the images shown to you and not on your general perception about the animals</i> in those images. </b>
				<li> For cases when the decision about similarity of a feature cannot be made on the basis of the content visible in images, you must check the <b>"Can't judge"</b> checkbox provided beside the slidebar for that feature.
				<li> Apart from features, you are also required to <b>rate the overall similarity</b> of images shown to you on the same scale of -5 to 5 as described above.
				<li> <b> Feature description: </b> Here is a brief description about the features on which to rate similarity of images.
					<ul type="square">
						<li><b>Body shape:</b> It refers to the shape of the animal irrespective of its size and other features. For eg, a dog and a horse have a similar body shape, irrespective of the difference between sizes of their body.
						<li><b>Skin texture:</b> A judgement should be based on how much similar is the outer skin on two animals as it is visible in images in aspects such as smoothness, luster, scales, etc.
						<li><b>Skin color:</b> How much different is the color of the outer skin of animals shown in images. Your decision should be based only on the particular animal shown in the image and not on your perception about the typical member of the species that animal belongs to.
						<li><b>Face Shape:</b> It refers to the face shape of animals shown in two images. Apart from shape, you can use characteristics such as size and structure of the face for making a similarity judgement about this feature.   
						<li><b>Mouth:</b> Rate the similarity on the basis of features of mouth such as its shape, color, size and other visible characteristics related to the mouth of animals in shown images. Note that this is not same as Face shape which refers to the shape of a complete face including that of mouth. 
						<li><b>Nose</b> As you may guess, your similarity rating for this feature will be based on the structure of nose of the animals in shown images. A nose may be long or short, pointed or flat, can be of different colors, etc. You are required to take into account such characteristics of the nose to make a decision. 
						<li><b>Ears</b> Similar to that of mouth and nose, only that this feature is about ears. Hence, your decision will be based on the shape, size, color and other visible characteristics of ears of animals in shown images. 
						<li><b>Horns:</b> Most animals have horns and most do not. Out of those who have, these horns again differ in their shape and size and numbers. Rate the similarity on the basis of such characteristics. Also, for a comparison between both animals without horns, select the "Can't judge" option.
						<li><b>Overall similarity:</b> On the scale of -5 to 5, make a similarity judgement about the two images displayed to you taking into account all of the above features and other characteristics that you might find to be similar or dissimilar in those images.
					</ul>
				<li> After you have decided upon the similarity rating for each feature and overall similarity for two images, you may either choose to get a <b>new trial</b> by clicking on the <b>"Next"</b> button or finish the experiment by clicking on the <b>"Submit"</b> button.
					<ul type="square">
						<li> If you click on "Next", you will get a new combination of images and you will have to perform the similarity judgement in the same way as you did for the previous trial.
						<li> If you click on "Submit", you will be exited from the experiment. 
					</ul>
